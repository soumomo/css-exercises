/*Solution ....i really did many mistakes in this one , in tried to apply flexbox , idk everywhere!! ....whereas things shouldn't have been thought that way , even the basic css functions would do the job and a small portion of flexbox property would create the final output , so keep in mind for the same in future projects , a gppd practice indeed......i've added the backup_index.html here , so that i can get back to my mistakes in future*/
